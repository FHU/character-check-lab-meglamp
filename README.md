Character Check Lab  
You may work with others on this lab.  

The check_character() function takes in two parameters, a string and an index. Fix the function so that it returns the type of the character at that index in the string. The type should be a letter, digit, white space, or unknown.  

For example:  
check_character('happy birthday', 2) should return "letter"  
check_character('happy birthday', 5) should return "white space"  
check_character('happy birthday 2 you', 15) should return "digit"  
check_character('happy birthday!', 14) should return "unknown"
